An Army PT Test Calculator in Java with supporting files.

The Army Physical Fitness Test (APFT) is comprised of three events worth 100 points each: pushups, situps, and a two-mile runs for a total of 300 points. The score of each event is dependant on how many repetitions of the exercise is done, and how fast the two-mile run is completed. The scores vary for gender and age. For example, if a 19 year old male soldier completed 44 pushups, he would receive 63 points for his pushup score. The three separate scores are added together for the total score. Each individual score must be above 60, therefore anything lower than 180/300 is a failed test. A total score above 180 can be a failure if one of the three scores was not at least 60 or higher. For example if a soldier received 75 points for pushups, 68 points for situps, and 55 points for the two-mile run, making 198/300, the soldier would've failed the APFT because their two-mile run score was below 60.
